## 🎶 A Journey into Vinyl DJing & Filming

Since I got back into vinyl DJing in **October**, the goal was always to eventually create **full video sets**—but I knew it would take time to get comfortable behind the decks. After months of practice, testing different angles, and working out my process, I finally filmed and released my first **fully produced DJ set video**.

This wasn’t just about making a mix—it was about creating an **immersive, intimate vinyl experience**. Unlike _My Analog Journal_ or _Humanos Studios_, I wanted something that felt more **authentic and homegrown** while still incorporating **high production value** with multiple camera angles.

I also built **Public Vinyl Radio** from scratch—designing the **logo, branding, website, and integrating it with Mixcloud** to make it a home for these mixes beyond just social media.

## 📀 The Setlist & Vibe

For this mix, I wanted a **Latin-inspired vibe**—mostly classics, but also featuring some of my **favorite records I’ve been spinning lately**. I didn’t want it to be a total variety mix, so I kept it cohesive while still making room for tracks that really resonated with me.

I organize my records in **U-Haul heavy-duty small boxes by genre**, which makes it easy to dig through and find the right vibe. I also keep my **Discogs library up to date**, which helps me browse and pull tracks that fit the mood of a mix. While I sometimes improvise, I always go into a session with a strong list of tracks in mind.

## 🎛️ The Setup – Gear & Filming Process

### **🔹 DJ Setup:**

- **Turntables:** Audio-Technica AT-120USB & AT-120XUSB
- **Mixer:** Ecler Warm 2
- **Cartridges:** AT-XP5
- **Speakers:** Elac Debut 3
- **Amp:** BasX A2m Stereo Flex Amplifier
- **Audio Interface:** Behringer U-Phono UFO202 USB

### **🎥 Filming Gear & Setup:**

- **Top Camera:** iPhone 11 (24mm lens)
- **Side Camera:** iPhone 16 Pro (24mm lens) with **Samsung SSD T5**
- **Front Wide Angle:** GoPro Hero 8
- **Mounting Gear:** Elgato ceiling mount, Neewer arm, MagSafe to 1/4" mount

Editing was done in **Final Cut Pro**, using **multi-cam clips**, which made choosing angles easy. **I switch angles multiple times per minute**, so this was one of the most time-consuming parts of editing. I applied minimal **color grading**, mostly enhancing color and lowering saturation.

## 🎥 Recording Challenges & Lessons Learned

I actually had to **record this set twice**. The first attempt had:

- ❌ **White balance issues** on the side camera
- ❌ **Bad audio fidelity** due to gain issues from the Behringer interface & Android test phone
- ❌ **Battery died on my iPhone 11 before the last track**

For the second attempt, I switched to **USB Audio Player Pro**, which **fixed the clipping issue**. I also made sure all **cameras were externally powered**, but my iPhone 11 still cut out early.

Overall, this was a **huge learning experience**, and I know future videos will be even smoother.

## 🔥 The Takeaway – What's Next?

It feels **great** to finally release a full video set and put it out there for the world to see. Right now, my social media following is small, so I wasn’t expecting huge views, but the **feedback has been valuable**.

For future sets, I plan to:

- ✅ **Dial in the aesthetics of the room** and improve lighting
- ✅ **Experiment with different outfits & setups**
- ✅ **Feature other DJs or people hanging out in the background**
- ✅ **Create subscriber content & behind-the-scenes tutorials** for aspiring vinyl DJs

I’m just getting started with **Public Vinyl Radio**, and I’m excited to keep refining these mixes. If you’re into **vinyl DJing, Latin grooves, or deep-cut selections**, hit subscribe and follow along!
