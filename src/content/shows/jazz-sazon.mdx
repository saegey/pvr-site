# Latin Currents & Vintage Grooves

A journey through Latin music’s deep conversation with jazz — where clave meets swing and romance dances with rhythm. From the velvet tones of vibraphone-led mambo to the smoky elegance of bolero, each track carries the improvisational spirit of jazz wrapped in the spice of salsa, guaracha, cha-cha, and cumbia. Sophisticated horn lines, rich harmonies, and timeless percussion guide the night from refined lounge warmth to dancefloor heat, and back into a lingering afterglow. This is Latin jazz dressed for the city — sharp, soulful, and ready to move.

The selections highlight the breadth of Latin and Afro-Cuban influence: hard-driving rhythm sections, lush horn arrangements, intricate percussion, and deep melodic storytelling. Vintage mambo and guaracha cuts sit comfortably alongside modern reimaginings, creating a timeless conversation between past and present.
