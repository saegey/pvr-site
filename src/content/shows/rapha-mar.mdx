This set was built for the bike, but not in the way you might think. Named after my cycling club, it channels movement more than sport: wheels turning, feet dancing, and rhythms spiraling out from Colombia to Ghana, São Paulo to Seattle. It’s the sonic equivalent of motion blur: hypnotic, propulsive, global.

It’s also the first set where I actively trimmed the playlist to fit within two hours and re-ordered it for vinyl flow. The final curation blends recent finds with old favorites, all lovingly collected on wax.

### 1. Hermanos Gutiérrez – "Rain God"

A meditative, reverberating opener

### 2. Antonio León – "Cumbia Triste"

From the _Música de Diciembre_ collection. A melancholic cumbia by Ecuadorian composer Luis Polibio Mayorga. Delicate and sentimental, grounding the set with wistful energy.

### 3. Terror/Cactus – "Espejismo (feat. Rumbo Tumba)"

Another one from Terror/Cactus, this time featuring Argentine producer Rumbo Tumba. Dreamy and dubby, like a mirage through tropical heatwaves.

### 4. Nicola Cruz – "Cumbia del Olvido"

A breakout track from Ecuador's Nicola Cruz. This one helped launch the Andean electronic scene. Psychedelic, misty, and deeply rhythmic.

### 5. Ronald Snijders – "Off the Groove"

Dutch-Surinamese flutist Snijders delivers this ultra-extended jazz-funk journey. A palette cleanser that stretches time, groove, and expectations.

### 6. Nu Genea – "Howls (feat. Tony Allen)"

Another Tony Allen cameo, this time with Naples duo Nu Genea. Electronic afrodisco that whispers and struts.

### 7. Los Bitchos – "The Link Is About to Die"

All-female UK quartet with Turkish psych and surf rock influences. Tight, twangy, and infectious. One of the most fun records in the crate.

### 8. La Redada – "Calla Boca"

Mexico City collective La Redada serve up a bouncy tropical jam with retro organ stabs and swaggering percussion. Funky but understated. Perfect bridge.

### 9. Ondatrópica – "Linda Mañana"

A Michi Sarmiento composition brought to life by the Colombian supergroup Ondatrópica. Nostalgic and lush, it captures the easy sweetness of its title: a "beautiful morning" for the dancefloor.

### 10. Conjunto Papa Upa – "Chicharrón Peluo"

Venezuelan-Dutch psychedelic funk with a sense of humor. Fuzzy guitar and playful chaos. The dancefloor gets weird.

### 11. Los Palteados - "El Palteado"

### 12. Don Chicharrón – "Valle"

Denver-based Latin psych outfit. "Valle" is melodic and dusty, a mood-lifter that still stays grounded.

### 13. Santana – "Guajira"

From _Santana III_. A simmering Latin rock groove, grounded by organ and congas. Vintage Santana never misses.

### 14. Dionisio Maio – "Dia Ja Manche"

From the _Space Echo_ compilation, capturing Cabo Verde’s cosmic synth-funk scene. Tropical with interstellar vibes.

### 15. Tony Allen & La BOA – "PATAS ARRIBA"

Colombian funk meets Nigerian afrobeat. A 2025 release that marries horns, grooves, and legacy. Rest in power, Tony.

### 16. La Sonora Mazurén – "Cachicha"

Bogotá-based La Sonora Mazurén lean into vintage Latin dance aesthetics. "Cachicha" is joyous and brassy, filled with tight breaks and cheeky energy.

### 17. La Sonora Mazurén – "Cavernicolas"

Another selection from this Bogotá powerhouse. "Cavernicolas" hits hard with psych-tinged brass and relentless timbales.

### 18. Los Átomos de Paramonga – "El Trencito"

From the legendary _Cumbia Beat Vol. 1_ compilation. Psychedelic guitar riffs ride the rhythm like a little train (hence the name). A Peruvian chicha gem that always gets smiles.

### 19. Los Frenéticos - "Macumba”

This song is a rhythmic surf-rock explosion soaked in Latin heat. “Macumba” takes its name from Afro-Brazilian spiritual practices, and the vibe definitely channels something mystical—like a desert ritual at sunset with fuzzed-out guitars and a conga groove.

### 20. Chicha Libre – "The Hungry Song"

Brooklyn meets the Amazon. Chicha Libre brings wah-wah guitars and tongue-in-cheek energy. A perfect late-set trip.

### 21. Meridian Brothers y Grupo Renacimiento – "Bomba Atómica"

From _Club Coco_. It's off-kilter, theatrical, and pulsing with experimental cumbia flavor. Wild finale vibes.

### 23. Ritmos Tropicosmos – "Noche Serena"

To close, a gentle descent. "Noche Serena" is night music: cosmic, lush, and slow-burning. The train pulls into the station.

### 24. Candeleros – "El Bravo"

From _Club Coco Ahora!_ A modern Colombian crew with deep roots. "El Bravo" swings hard with gritty vocals and swirling guitars.

### 25. Afrosound – "Sabor Navideño (Coros)"

Colombian Christmas vibes, but funky. This one straddles the line between seasonal and year-round dancefloor fuel.

### 26. Antoine Dougbé - "Honton Soukpo Gnon”

An absolute gem of Afro-funk from Benin, featured as track 3 on the Legends of Benin compilation released by Analog Africa in 2009.

### 27. Terror/Cactus – "Churro Vs. Crow"

A cumbia-electro hybrid by Seattle's masked maestro. Dark, surfy riffs bounce over programmed beats. There’s humor and grit beneath the groove.

### 28. Los Golden Boys – "Se Trabó la Banda"

Short and punchy. A golden-age Colombian party starter. Whistles, keys, and rhythmic breaks. Always a hit.

### 29. Adrian Quesada & College of Knowledge – "Eso No Lo He Dicho Yo"

Quesada explores psychedelic bolero here. Smoky, dramatic, and cinematic—it slows the tempo just enough.

### 30. Soda Stereo - "Si No Fuera Por…” (1985)

This track feels like wandering through a neon-lit city at night — detached yet emotional, minimal yet powerful. Gustavo Cerati’s ethereal vocals hover over a sparse, pulsing groove carried by synth bass, chilly drum machines, and reverb-soaked guitar stabs. The lyrics are fragmented and introspective, evoking longing and isolation with poetic restraint.

### 31. ROSALÍA – "CANDY"

A modern ballad reimagined with reggaetón swing and R&B softness. Tender and intimate. A rare vocal centerpiece.

### 32. Pedro Laza y Sus Pelayeros – "Lamento Guajiro"

An early cumbia from one of the greats. The clarinet melody is instantly recognizable, melancholy but danceable.

### 33. Talking Heads – "Crosseyed and Painless"

The set's boldest curveball. Afrobeat rhythms filtered through David Byrne and Brian Eno's post-punk lens. It somehow fits perfectly.
