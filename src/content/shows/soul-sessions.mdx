## Featured Tracks

### 1. “A Little Soul Party” – Ohio Players

Originally issued on the 1976 compilation A Little Soul Party, this track mines the band’s 1968 sessions for First Impressions and Observations in Time, pairing tight horn charts with a buoyant bassline for irresistible early-funk energy.
As an opener, its upbeat tempo and celebratory vibe immediately set the tone for a dance-floor-ready mix.

### 2. “Don’t Fight It” – Wilson Pickett

First recorded in 1967 during Pickett’s Atlantic era, “Don’t Fight It” fuses his raw, gospel-influenced vocals with a driving R&B groove that prefigures his Stax hits.
Pickett’s gritty delivery and punchy horn stabs make it a quintessential southern-soul rocker that still packs a lasting punch.

### 3. “Les Fleurs” – Minnie Riperton

Originally released in 1970 on Riperton’s Perfect Angel, “Les Fleurs” is a two-minute orchestral soul vignette showcasing her soaring five-octave range and lush string arrangement.
Its recent film placements in Back to Black and The Idea of You have re-introduced the song’s ethereal beauty to new audiences, cementing its status as a cinematic soul classic.

### 4. “Give the People What They Want” – The O’Jays

As the title track of their 1995 album, The O’Jays deliver one of their funkiest performances here—stinging, flanged bass and punchy horns drive this call for unity and social justice.
Its upbeat, dance-floor groove and empowering lyrics make it a timeless Philly-soul anthem for any celebratory mix segment.

### 5. “Keep It Up” – Milton Wright

Featured on Wright’s 2009 LP Friends and Buddies, “Keep It Up” channels classic Miami soul via live horns, warm organ swells, and a propulsive backbeat.
The track’s catchy call-and-response vocals and steady groove offer a perfect mid-set energy boost.

### 6. “It’s a New Day” – Skull Snaps

Cut in 1973, “It’s a New Day” centers on one of funk’s most seminal drum breaks—a raw, syncopated groove that’s been sampled countless times in hip-hop.
Its sparse arrangement and explosive drum pattern make it an essential pick for deep-funk transitions that keep crowds locked in.

### 7. “Close the Door” – Joe Tex

Issued in 1972 as the B-side to “A Sweet Woman Like You,” this late-‘60s soul ballad showcases Tex’s tender, pleading vocals over a warm, orchestrated backdrop.
Its smooth rhythm and emotive delivery create a standout slow-jam perfect for a late-night set moment.

### 8. “Stand Up” – Lee Fields & Sugarman & Co.

Released in 2009 on Daptone, “Stand Up” sees Fields and the Sugarman crew lay down commanding funk: galloping congas, gritty brass hooks, and Fields’ impassioned vocal calls.
The track’s psychedelic outro and raw soul energy make it an ideal high-impact cut for peak-time dance-floor action.

### 9. “Ease Back” – The Meters

Dropped in July 1969 as the third single from their debut, “Ease Back” features Zigaboo Modeliste’s syncopated drumming and Leo Nocentelli’s slinky guitar, defining the band’s signature New Orleans funk sound.
Its tight groove and minimalist arrangement have made it a crate-digging staple for DJs seeking authentic funk breaks.

### 10. “There Will Be Love” – Lou Rawls

Written by Gamble & Huff, “There Will Be Love” highlights Rawls’ embrace of the lush Philly-soul aesthetic, blending his velvet baritone with sweeping instrumentation.
The song’s expansive string arrangements and heartfelt vocal performance leave listeners uplifted—an ideal closer for a soul-driven set.
